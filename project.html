        <h3> Roblox </h3>
        <p>I have created characters in a popular game 'All Star Tower Defense.' Through meticulous design and
            scripting, I have crafted dynamic and visually captivating characters that enhance the gameplay experience
            and contribute to the game's overall success. My dedication to detail and commitment to excellence ensure
            that each character I create not only meets but exceeds the expectations of players, enriching their
            immersion in the game world and driving engagement.</p>

        <h3> Hmoob Boat Battles </h3>
        <p>Collaborating closely with my partner, Evan Her, I played a pivotal role in the development of a Battleship
            game. Throughout the project, we encountered numerous challenges which demanded effective problem-solving
            and communication. By working together, we successfully navigated through obstacles, achieving our
            objectives. Working with a partner enhanced my communication skills through active dialogue and negotiation
            but also elevated my coding proficiency.</p>

        <h3> CSS Zen Garden </h3>
        
        <p> CSS Zen Garden was the first project I worked on that uses CSS. When doing this project I had many struggles. 
            I over come these struggles by asking my peers for help and looking up solutions online. Doing this proejct 
            perpared me for whats to come in my other works. Since then, I have grown my knowledge in CSS.
