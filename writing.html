        <h3> Scholarship application </h3>
        <p>It would be an honor and a great experience to receive the scholarship for the Senior Tour. I am grateful for
            this opportunity to tell my story. I am a first generation, Asian-American. My parents are refugees from
            Laos, and we were the first in our family tree to be members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
            Saints. Currently, I am a senior in high school and will be graduating in 2 weeks.</p>


        <p>
            I am working on my mission papers and hoping to set out by August of this year. If I had the wonderful
            opportunity to go on the Senior Tour, that would greatly impact my life as I know it would be a great
            testimony builder and I can meet other individuals just like me. When my family joined the church, I was
            just 2 years old.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I got older, one of the first lessons I was taught and remembered most was of Joseph Smith. I studied a
            lot in the Pearl of Great Price throughout my personal readings, and found my own testimony of the prophet
            Joseph Smith. He was such a brave and faithful leader. He is a great definition of walking by faith and not
            by sight. He did so much to restore the church, all because of his faith and love for Heavenly Father and
            Jesus Christ.
        </p>

        <p>
            It would be such an awesome experience to see the historic grounds of Joseph Smith and his family, along
            with the humble beginnings of the church. In our stake, we do a youth campout once a year. It's essentially
            a conference for 3 days, filled with fun activities and workshops. I have loved these youth conferences each
            year and looked forward to them. I love spending time away from the outside world, getting rid of the
            electronics, and just focusing on my spiritual growth alongside others that are just like me.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have met many amazing people at these youth conferences, and together, we help lift each other up. I love
            hearing testimonies of these humble youth that share their vulnerable stories and trials because it makes me
            feel heard and that I'm not alone. Being able to attend the Senior Tour would allow me to create new
            friendships. Especially since I'm preparing to go on a mission, it's nice to have friends around you that
            are at the same milestones as you. I also love sharing and hearing testimonies from my peers.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe and know that we were not meant to go on this journey of life on earth alone. We have friends, for
            a big purpose to share burdens with, uplift each other, and grow together. I know that as I go on this trip,
            it'll be such a wholesome experience. There are so many great monuments and places that will be visited
            that's part of my personal bucket list.
        </p>

        <p>
            I can take what I learned back home and tell my immediate family about it. I can also take it with me on my
            mission and help teach and share to others about my testimony and faith. Especially being a first
            generation, I want to share my knowledge and be a living testament to my other family members who are not of
            the same faith. I would like to thank you for taking the time to read about my story and for your consideration. me faith.
