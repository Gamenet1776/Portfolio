    <p>Nice to meet you

        I am Vincent Vang, I am a student at The Center of Advance Research and Technology and Clovis East. I specialize
        in scripting within the Roblox platform, where I focus on developing dynamic characters for various games. These
        characters are meticulously crafted to engage in strategic battles with others within the gaming environment.

        My short-term goal is to learn more about Lua language, to increase my proficiency in scripting. My long-term
        career goal is to script and make a successful game. I hope to expand my connections so my game can get popular.
        I became interested in this field because I want to challenge myself.
